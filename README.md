## 🔄 Buddy Rotation System

**Quarterly Rotation Structure:**
- **Buddy 1:** Delphi Specialist + Senior E-commerce Dev
- **Buddy 2:** Ops Lead + Junior Legacy Dev
- **Buddy 3:** Security Champion + Business Analyst

**Ceremonies:**
- ⏲ Weekly hand-off: 30min sync + docs always updated
- 🤝 Co-pairing: 2h/week on critical tasks
- 📈 Metric: “Bus Factor” ≥ 3 (at least 3 people know every critical process)

---

## 📈 Adaptive Governance

- **Bi-weekly Reviews**
  - Health Check: Workload emojis (🟢🟡🔴) + justification
  - Velocity Review: Scope adjustment if <70% of goals reached
  - Celebration Board: 3 small wins celebrated
- **Framework:**
  - If 2+ devs in 🔴 twice in a row → urgent priority review
  - Happiness <3.5 → Sprint focused on well-being/tech health

---

## 🎓 Continuous Learning Engine

- **Onboarding Program (First 30 days):**
  - 🧳 Day 1: DevOps Starter Kit + sandbox
  - 🤝 Week 1: Pair with buddy + review 5 critical runbooks
  - 🚦 Month 1: First supervised deploy + 360° feedback

- **Quarterly Refresh**
  - Watch a key screen recording
  - 10-min pipeline quiz
  - Mandatory update of one runbook as exercise

---

## 🗣️ Customer Voice Integration

- **Feature Feedback:** In-app NPS after releases
- **Game Day Comms:** Pre-game day email, opt-out for critical users
- **Change Advisory:** Biweekly “What Changed” newsletter
- **Metric:** CSAT after release > 4.2/5

---

## 🎪 Workload & Focus Management

- **WIP Limit:** Max 3 parallel initiatives/team
- “Focus Sprint”: 1/month purely for technical debt
- **Visual Board:** Physical or digital Kanban with column limits
- **DevOps Dashboard:**

  - Cycle time by task type
  - Weekly “focus score” (0-100%)

---

## 🔁 Knowledge Refresh Protocol

- **Quarterly:**
  - “Challenge Day”: New buddy executes critical procedure solo
  - 10% of runbooks randomly audited
  - Cross-team quizzes

- **If >30% fail the quiz → Mandatory knowledge sharing sprint**

---

## 📈 Cultural Health Index (CHI)

| Indicator                | Target        |
|--------------------------|--------------|
| Psychological Safety     | > 4.0        |
| Knowledge Distribution   | Bus Factor ≥ 3|
| Sustainable Pace         | ≤ 20% 🔴     |
| Continuous Learning      | ≥ 85% refreshed |
| Cross-team Collaboration | 2 pairings/week |
